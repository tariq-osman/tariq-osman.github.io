I am an Instructor in Mathematics at Brandeis University. Previously, I was a Ph.D. at Queen's University, under the supervision of [Francesco Cellarosi](https://sites.google.com/view/fcellaro/home). I am interested in problems at the intersection of Dynamical Systems, Number Theory, and Probability.
