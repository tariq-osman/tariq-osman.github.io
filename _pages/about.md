I am an Instructor in Mathematics at [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/mathematics/). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in 2022 at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/), under the supervision of [Francesco Cellarosi](https://sites.google.com/view/fcellaro/home). I am interested in problems at the intersection of Dynamical Systems, Number Theory, and Probability.
